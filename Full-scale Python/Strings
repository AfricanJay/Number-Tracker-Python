-------STRING-------------
#text characters, can also have numbers as strings if they are enclosed in quotations. works with either signle or double

#if you are going to have a single quote in the string, encase the entire string in doubles and vice versa."

Example:
print('I'm using single quotes, but this will create an error')

#the above will throw and error, but encase in doubles and it works.

#escape character to print a new line:

print('Use \n to print a new line')  #forward slash n

[output]
use
to print a new line

#Multi-line strings:

a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""

print(a)
